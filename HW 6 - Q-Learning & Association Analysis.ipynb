    "### Game States\n",
    "For Q-Learning, the agent needs to keep a Q-Table of game states. To keep the number of possible game states manageable, we will define the game state as a combination of:\n",
    "* Horizontal orientation from the food - is the food currently to the left or the right of the snake's head? (-1: left, 0: same, 1: right)\n",
    "* Vertical orientation from the food - is the food currently above or below the snake's head? (-1: below, 0: same, 1: above) \n",
    "* What are in the squares adjacent to the snake's head - are there walls or snake tail in these squares? (1 indicates something is there, 0 indicates it is open)\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment (which is in the provided `game_loop.py` file) will provide this state in the form of two tuples:\n",
    "- The first tuple will contain (relative horizontal orientation to food, relative vertical orientation to food).\n",
    "- The second tuple will contain the squares surrounding the snake's head in the form of (up, down, left, right) where a 1 indicates wall or tail is in that square and 0 indicates that square is open.\n",

    "* `__init__`: The constructor sets up some constants and sets the learning parameter values. Do not change the learning parameter values for part 1 of this assignment. It also calls init_qtable to initialize the Q-Table. \n",
    "* `init_qtable`: Initializes the Q-Table. The `qtable` is implemented as a dictionary of state -> list of four Q-Values, representing the four action choices of [left, right, up, down].\n",
    "* `save` and `load`: Saves the Q-Values (via pickle) so the agent can be re-loaded later via load.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two additional methods in the SnakeAgent class **that you will implement**. These will be called by the `game_loop.py` file.\n",

The agent can choose to explore randomly with a probability of epsilon or to exploit the learned Q-values to select the next action.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this method, you should:\n",

    "  - Exploit: Select the action with the highest Q-value for the current state\n",
    "- Record the current state and action, as you'll need these later for the update method (use `self.curr_state` and `self.curr_act`)\n",
    "- Return the chosen action as a string (use `self.ACTION_STRING_MAP` in the SnakeAgent class)"
